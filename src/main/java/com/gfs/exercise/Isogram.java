 * An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that
 * determines whether a given string contains only letters.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1. Assume the empty string is an isogram.
 * 2. Assume null is not an isogram.
 * 3. Ignore letter case.
 * 4. A String containing any character other than a letter should throw an IllegalArgumentException
 * <p>

 * isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" == true
 * isIsogram "aba" == false
 * isIsogram "moOse" == false -- ignore letter case
